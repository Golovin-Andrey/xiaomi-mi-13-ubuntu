# Otions for the amd parser within autofs.
#
# amd configuration options that are aren't used, haven't been
# implemented or have different behaviour within autofs.
#
# A number of the amd configuration options are not used by autofs,
# some because they are not relevant within autofs, some because
# they are done differently in autofs and others that are not yet
# implemented.
#
# Since "mount_type" is always autofs (because there's no user space
# NFS server) the configuration entries relating to that aren't used.
# Also, server availability is done differently within autofs so the
# options that relate to the amd server monitoring sub-system are
# also not used.
#
# These options are mount_type, auto_attrcache, portmap_program,
# nfs_vers_ping, nfs_allow_any_interface, nfs_allow_insecure_port,
# nfs_proto, nfs_retransmit_counter, nfs_retransmit_counter_udp,
# nfs_retransmit_counter_tcp, nfs_retransmit_counter_toplvl,
# nfs_retry_interval, nfs_retry_interval_udp, nfs_retry_interval_tcp,
# nfs_retry_interval_toplvl and nfs_vers.
#
#
# Other options that are not used within the autofs implementation:
#
# log_file, truncate_log - autofs used either stderr when running in
#	the foreground or sends its output to syslog so an alternate
#	log file (or truncating the log) can't be used.
#
# print_pid - there's no corresponding option for this within autofs.
#
# use_tcpwrappers, show_statfs_entries - there's no user space NFS
#	server to control access to so this option isn't relevant.
#	The show_statfs_entries can't be implemented for the same
#	reason.
#
# debug_mtab_file - there's no user space NFS server and autofs
#	avoids using file based mtab whenever possible.
#
# sun_map_syntax - obviously, are provided by autofs itself.
#
# plock, show_statfs_entries, preferred_amq_port - not supported.
#
# ldap_cache_maxmem, ldap_cache_seconds - external ldap caching
#	is not used by autofs.
#
# ldap_proto_version - autofs always attempts to use the highest
#	available ldap protocol version.
#
# cache_duration, map_reload_interval, map_options - the map
#	entry cache is continually updated and stale entries
#	cleaned on re-load, which is done when map changes are
#	detected so these configuration entries are not used
#	by autofs.
#
# localhost_address - is not used within autofs. This
#	configuration option was only used in the amd user
#	space server code and is not relevant within autofs.
#
#
# Options that are handled differently within autofs:
#
# pid_file - must be given as a command line option on startup.
#
# print_version - program version and feature information is obtained
#	by using the automount command line option "-V".
#
# debug_options, log_options - autofs has somewhat more limited
#	logging and debug logging options. When the log_options
#	options is encountered it is converted to the nearest
#	matching autofs logging option. Since the configuration
#	option debug_options would be handled the same way it
#	is ignored.
#
# restart_mounts - has no sensible meaning within autofs because autofs
#	always tries to re-connect to existing mounts. While this
#	has its own set of problems not re-connecting to existing
#	mounts always results in a non-functional automount tree if
#	mounts were busy at the last shutdown (as is also the case
#	with amd when using mount_type autofs).
#
# forced_unmounts - detaching mounts often causes serious problems
#	for users of existing mounts. It is used by autofs in some
#	cases, either at the explicit request of the user (with a
#	command line or init option) and in some special cases during
#	program operation but is avoided whenever possible.
#
#
# A number of configuration options are not yet implemented:
#
# fully_qualified_hosts - not yet implemented.
#
# unmount_on_exit - since autofs always tries to re-connect
#	to mounts left mounted from a previous shutdown this
#	is a sensible option to implement and that will be
#	done.
#
# browsable_dirs - not yet implemented.
#
# exec_map_timeout - a timeout is not currently used for
#	for program maps, might be implemented.
#
# tag - the tag option is not implemented within autofs.
#
#
# Supported options:
#
# arch, karch, os, osver - these options default to what is returned
#	from uname(2) and can be overridden if required.
#
# full_os - has no default and must be set in the configuration
#	if used in maps.
#
# cluster - if not set defaults to the host domain name. This option
#	corresponds to the HP_UX cluster name (according to the amd
#	source) and is probably not used in Linux but is set anyway.
#
# vendor - has a default value of "unknown", it must be set in the
#	configuration if used in maps.
#
# auto_dir - is the base name of the mount tree used for external
#	mounts that are sometimes needed by amd maps. Its default
#	value is "/a".
#
# map_type - specifies the autofs map source, such as file, nis,
#	ldap etc. and has no default value set.
#
# map_defaults - is used to override /defaults entries within maps
#	and can be used to provide different defaults on specific
#	machines without having to modify centrally managed maps.
#	It is empty by default.
#
# search_path - colon seperated paths to search for maps that
#	are not specified as a full path.
#
# dismount_interval - is equivalent to the autofs timeout option. It
#	is only possible to use this with type "auto" mounts due
#	to the way the autofs kernel module performs expiry. It
#	takes its default value from the autofs internal default
#	of 600 seconds.
#
# autofs_use_lofs - if set to "yes" autofs will attempt to use bind
#	mounts for type "auto" when possible.
#
# nis_domain - allows setting of a domain name other than the system
#	default.
#
# local_domain - is used to override (or set) the host domain name.
#
# normalize_hostnames - if set to "yes" then the contents of ${rhost}
#	is translated in its official host name.
#
# domain_strip - if set to "yes" the domain name part of the host
# 	is strippped when normalizing hostnames. This can be useful
#	when using of the same maps in a multiple domain environment.
#
# normalize_slashes - is set to "yes" by default and will collapse
#	multiple unescaped occurrences of "/" to a single "/".
#
# selectors_in_defaults, selectors_on_default - has a default value
#	of "no". If set to "yes" then any defaults entry will be
#	checked for selectors to determine the values to be used.
#	selectors_in_defaults is the preferred option to use.
#
# ldap_base - has no default value. It must be set to the base dn
#	that is used for queries if ldap is to be used as a map
#	source.
#
# ldap_hostports - has no default value set. It must be set to
#	the URI of the LDAP server to be used for lookups when
#	ldap is used a map source. It may contain a comma or
#	space seperated list of LDAP URIs.
#
# hesiod_base - the base name used for hesiod map sources.
#
# Additional configuration options added:
#
# linux_ufs_mount_type - set the default system filesystem type that's
#	used for mount type ufs. There's no simple way to determine
#	what the system default filesystem is and am-utils needs to
#	be continually updated to do this and can easily get it wrong
#	anyway.
